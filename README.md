### Relevant observations and patterns implemented

ðŸ’¡ Reflection pattern used to dynamically load (in execution time) file parsers that would allow the importation of batch files with touristic points and hotels.  <br />
ðŸ’¡ Dependency injection in the BE services and logic interfaces. This allowed us to reduce dependencies and favor mocking during automatic testing.<br />
ðŸ’¡ Repository pattern applied to allow inheritance of common operations for the Repository classes<br />
ðŸ’¡ Strategy pattern applied to abstract the price calculation logic for the reservations, making it easier to modify for new implementations.<br />
ðŸ’¡ GRASP and SOLID Principles applied. Read more about in the documentation<br />
